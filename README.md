# ThirdSemester
Repository containing solutions to problems from the CMC MSU third semester course
Most of the directories contain c-files, each directory has solutions to problems on a specific theme (tasks are grouped by seminar number). However, several seminars had a non-coding tasks, so they are not included in this repository:
+ 2 seminar - ssh
+ 9 seminar - gdb

Also I felt like it will be a good decision to left files I used when testing my programs. Maybe it can also make a little bit clearer how the program works.
